You can download some Skins from Maniapark. Skins are the 3D Models for a Player.
The Files are simple zip Files or gbx Files (Nadeo Game Box). Dont ask me how to create gbx Files, i dont know.

Save the Skins into your Documents Folder. After that you can select the Model in your Profile Settings (Shootmania).
